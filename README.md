# Getting and cleaning data course project

## Introduction


The goal of the course project is to produce tidy data from accelerometer measurements from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone of 30 volunteer individuals. The raw data was downloaded from this site: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>
Data was originally obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphone>

## Contents


This repository contains the following files:

1. README.md - describes contents of the repository and how files/scripts are related to each other
2. CodeBook.md - describes the tidy data set, its variables, and transformations performed on the data
3. run_analysis.R - collects and cleans up raw data; this will be described in detail in the next section
4. tidy_data_set.txt - the output of the run_analysis.R script


## run_analysis.R

This script should be run from the directory where the folder **UCI HAR Dataset** is located. This script performs the following steps:

1. Creates a single data set by merging the training and test data sets.
2. Extracts mean and standard deviation (std) measurements only (i.e. columns/variables with mean and std in their labels)
3. Replaces numerical activity labels with descriptive labels (i.e. 1 replaced with "walking", etc.)
4. Labels variables with meaningful, descriptive names, removing non-alphanumeric characters in the process
5. Creates a second tidy data set, separate from that generated by the first 4 steps, that includes the average of each variable for each activity for each indiviual subject

The tidy data set will be saved as tidy_data_set.txt
